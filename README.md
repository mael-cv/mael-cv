- 👋 Hi, I’m [Maël Chebbi Vigneau](https://instagram.com/mael.cv)
- 👀 I have been interested in new technologies since I was 6 years old and have already carried out amateur projects linking web development, machine learning, network engineering and many other sectors.
I maintain my range of skills by practicing regularly (in my free time or during class hours) and enrich my knowledge by trying to learn more and more.
- 🌱 I am currently a student at the Efrei school on the Bordeaux campus in Bachelors in Web & Application Development.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on various digital projects
